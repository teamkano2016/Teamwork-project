## Project description:

The project is a C# Console Application. It allows the user to navigate on a field using the arrow keys. The goal is to defeat the enemies and continue to the next level. The player has a set of abilities: firing bullets, gathering potions and teleporting. If the player isn't able to avoid the constant shooting from the enemies he looses health points and therefore lives.
